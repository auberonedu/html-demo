# HTML Exploration

1. In your group, choose one person to be the starter.
1. Have the starter open [SyncFiddle](https://syncfiddle.net/) in a new tab. They should then click "Create New Room".
1. On the left side of the page there will be some HTML code. Have the starter delete all of it.
1. Have the starter invite all other groupmates to the fiddle. There will be a grey button labeled "Share". The starter should click the button. A dialog will pop up with a URL. The starter should copy the URL from the dialog and paste it into the Zoom chat so all the other groupmates can join.
1. Have one person copy the code from [example.html](example.html) into the large left textbox on the fiddle. It should automatically appear for everyone else.
1. Every person should click the green "Run" button at the top of their page. You should expect to see some text and a picture show up on the right hand side.
1. As a group, attempt to figure out how the HTML works. Discuss what you think different parts do. Test your theories by editing the HTML and clicking the Run button again to see the changes.
1. It is 100% OK to not fully understand what's going on or to "mess up" parts of the page. If it gets too broken, just copy over the example code and start over! We'll discuss in detail over the next few weeks what the code is doing, and how to make it do more!
