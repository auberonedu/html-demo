    <p> Please experiment a bit with this page. Look at the <em>HTML</em>, and try to figure out what different parts do. Try changing parts of it and seeing what happens! Press the green "Run" button to see your changes. Each member of your group needs to press the button to see the changes on their own computer. Don't worry if everything breaks, you can always copy the code back from the example and start over.</p>
    
    <p> A few things to try: </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Can you change what some of the text says?</li>
      <li>Can you add another bullet point to this list?</li>
      <li>Can you change the image to something else?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Don't stress too much, and have fun!</p>
